-Create an express server to serve up your client side application, remember that this is a
different application than your server side application and hence has a different "server".

-Create separate app and build folders.

-Create a gulpfile that will both copy static html files from app to build and create a webpack bundle.

-Create a client side app using webpack that

  2. Updates that time every second.
